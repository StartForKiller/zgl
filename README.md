# ZGL â€“ Zig OpenGL Bindings

This library provides a thin, type-safe binding for OpenGL.

## Example

```zig
// Use classic OpenGL flavour
var vao = gl.createVertexArray();
defer gl.deleteVertexArray(vao);

// Use object oriented flavour
var vertex_buffer = gl.Buffer.create();
defer vertex_buffer.delete();
```

## Development Philosophy

This library is developed incrementally. That means that functions and other things will be included on-demand and not just for the sake of completeness.

If you think a function is missing, fork the library, implement the missing function similar to the other functions and make a pull request. Issues that request implementation of missing functions will be closed immediately.

## Generated Bindings

This library includes bindings for OpenGL 1.0 through 4.6, as well as OpenGL ES 1.0 through 3.2, generated by [zig-opengl](https://github.com/MasterQ32/zig-opengl). Alternate bindings can be selected in your build.zig file:

```zig
const zgl_dep = b.dependency("zgl", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
    .binding_version = @as([]const u8, "VERSION_4_1"), // for ES versions, use "ES_VERSION_2_0"
});
```
